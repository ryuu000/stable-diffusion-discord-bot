# Discord bot commands

`!dream prompt` to create images
`/dream prompt` as above

Heres an example request with most options used manually

`!dream a redneck Vitalik+ man wearing a tank top, sunglasses, drinking beer, doing a thumbs up gesture, dancing, laughing at his house being on fire, high quality, detailed, a beautiful retrowave artwork, trending on artstation withLora(vitalik,0.8) withLora(add_detail,1.2) [<neg-sketch-2>] --width 697 --height 929 --steps 30 --seed 951987030 --scale 7 --sampler ddim --model degenerate526urpm --hires_fix --upscale_level 2 --upscale_strength 0.5 --gfpgan_strength 0.5`

# When replying to a render:

`.. ` 2 dots and a space will allow you to modify an existing render, follow it with additions to the prompt or !dream parameters  . All other settings from the render you reply to will be kept, except for hires_fix and upscaling options.

`inpaint prompt` will use the replied image as a template, use the inpainting model and inpaint your prompt. If the image has transparencies, those will be filled. If it does not, use the `--mask face` to automatically select areas matching your search (face) and replace them with your prompt. If width and height are not set, they will automatically match the input image.

`template prompt` will take the image you reply to, set it as a template and set the matching width/height . You can follow your prompt with any of the usual settings from !dream .  If width and height are not set, they will automatically match the input image.

`seed` replies with an easy to copy seed number

`info` replies with the full !dream command to recreate the image you reply to

`samplers ddim plms` will rerun the render using whatever samplers you choose, 1 by 1

`models model1 model2` will rerun the render with whatever model names you give it
